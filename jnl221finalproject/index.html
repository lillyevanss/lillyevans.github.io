       Since marijuana’s legalization in Colorado in 2014, only 22 states have followed its lead and legalized recreational marijuana use as of 2023. The controversy surrounding marijuana’s legalization is often questioned by many Americans – with most saying, “why not?” There are a plethora of reasons that marijuana legalization is beneficial to not only states, but rather the country as a whole. 

       <p> 

        First, some background information. Marijuana is not an addictive drug. It is often used medicinally to treat a variety of conditions, such as cancer, epilepsy, AIDS, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, and more. As of this year, 38 states have legalized the use of medical marijuana. So that begs the question – if marijuana is safe to use as a form of medicine, why isn’t it allowed recreationally?

Another problem that marijuana’s legalization aids is the issue of drug-related arrests.<a href="https://insight.livestories.com/s/the-effects-of-marijuana-legalization-in-colorado/55105ff9a750b3552448cd18/#:~:text=With%20the%20legalization%20of%20marijuana,%2440%20million%20dollars%20in%202014.&text=Marijuana%20related%20hospitalizations%20have%20increased%20substantially%20since%20its%20commercialization%20in%202009."> According to Live Stories,</a> “With the legalization of marijuana, the State of Colorado has experienced a decrease in marijuana related arrests by 84%, saving the state between $12 million and $40 million dollars in 2014.” <p>


<p>
  In terms of the economy, the state of Colorado has benefited greatly – gaining about $13.5 billion in sales, which resulted in nearly $2.3 billion in tax revenue.<p>

    <p>
      So, in a political climate where the health of the economy is at the forefront of lawmakers’ minds, what’s the hesitation? Over 200 House Republicans voted against the legalization of marijuana on a federal level, and only three voted toward it. GOP lawmaker’s negative views towards legalization do not align with the overall attitude of Americans – a variety of studies show that nearly 7 in 10 Americans see no problem with the legalization of marijuana. However, resistance from Republican lawmakers is a major obstacle when it comes to marijuana legalization. This could be because most republican representatives are traditionally of older age, and are more religious, which heavily contrasts with the demographic that is in favor of marijuana legalization, which tends to be younger democrats with little to no religious affiliations. Regardless of the potential uptick in economic prosperity that could come with legalization, republican lawmakers are more likely to vote against something that does not align with their voters’ moral principles. <p>

        <p> 
        Krista Stafford, the Vice President of Marketing at Partner Colorado Credit Union in Littleton, Colorado, says the federal illegalization of marijuana proves to cause issues when it comes to banking as well. She says, “These people in the cannabis business aren’t able to open accounts with big banks because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level. It can be really dangerous because a lot of the time they’ll just carry around backpacks with huge amounts of cash in them, since their business isn’t able to have an account with a federal bank.” </p>

        <p>
        Overall, the cannabis industry has been on an exponential uptick for years now, and it is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Colorado is a prime example of how legalizing recreational marijuana can prove to cause a substantial boost for the economy. The health benefits that are associated with cannabis largely outweigh the risks, and looking at the larger picture, federal legalization simply makes sense. </p>
